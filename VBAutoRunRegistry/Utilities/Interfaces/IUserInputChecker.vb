Namespace Utilities.Interfaces

    ''' <summary>
    ''' Defines methods for checking user input related to application setup decisions.
    ''' </summary>
    ''' <remarks>
    ''' The <see cref="IUserInputChecker"/> interface provides a method for prompting the user and obtaining their decision
    ''' on whether to proceed with the application setup, such as installing a service. Implementations of this interface
    ''' should include the logic for interacting with the user to gather their input and make decisions based on their response.
    ''' 
    ''' The <see cref="IUserInputChecker.ShouldProceed"/> method is designed to solicit a confirmation from the user, returning <c>True</c>
    ''' if the user opts to proceed with the action or <c>False</c> otherwise. This allows the application to conditionally
    ''' execute further setup steps based on user consent.
    ''' </remarks>

        ''' <summary>
        ''' Prompts the user to decide whether to proceed with the application setup.
        ''' </summary>
        ''' <returns>
        ''' <c>True</c> if the user inputs 'Y' (case-insensitive) to indicate they want to proceed; otherwise, <c>False</c>.
        ''' </returns>
        ''' <remarks>
        ''' Implementing classes should prompt the user to confirm whether they wish to continue
        ''' with actions such as installing a service. The method reads the user's input from the console or other input
        ''' sources, and returns <c>True</c> if the input is 'Y' (case-insensitive), indicating that the user wants to proceed.
        ''' Any other input will result in <c>False</c>, signaling that the user does not want to proceed.
        ''' 
        ''' The <see cref="ShouldProceed"/> method helps in making runtime decisions based on user feedback and is crucial
        ''' for interactive setup processes where user consent is required before performing certain actions.
